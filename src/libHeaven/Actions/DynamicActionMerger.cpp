     * @brief       Add dynamic actions to an action structure
     *
     * A DynamicActionMerger (DAM) is used to populate a structure with dynamic actions. It has two
     * modes of operation:
     *
     * -   __Callback__:
     *     This is a _active_ mode. Every time that the framework internally rebuilds the actions, a
     *     call back slot is invoked. It's task is to setup a list of actions that the framework
     *     will use in the place of the DynamicActionMerger.
     *
     * -   __Advanced__:
     *     The advanced mode is more _passive_. The owner installs a list of actions or key/value
     *     pairs into the DAM and this list will be used in the place of the DynamicActionMerger.
     *
     * The mode can be set with setMode(), the merger slot can be set via setMergerSlot().
     *
     * As with all UiObject classes, a DAM is typically not created directly but rather through the
     * help of a @ref md_HID "HID file".
     *
     * @fn          DynamicActionMerger::entryTriggered( QVariant value )
     * @brief       Emitted when an action got triggered
     *
     * @param[in]   value   The value that was used to add the action that has been triggered.
     *
     * This signal is emitted when an action got triggered.

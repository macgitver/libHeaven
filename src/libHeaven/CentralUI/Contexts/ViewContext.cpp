     * @class   ViewContext
     * @ingroup CentralUI
     * @brief   A context that a view provides to other views
     *
     * A ContextView is able to provide and to consume contexts. A context represents the current
     * state of inter-dependent views.
     *
     * A master view is said to _provide_ a context and this context will automatically be attached
     * to slave views that have associated themselves with the master. They _consume_ the context.
     *
     * A _context consumer_ has the ability to store additional data into the context. This can be
     * achieved through ViewContextData objects.
     *
     * When a context and/or associated data is no longer in active use, it will be dropped after
     * a grace period.
     *
     * Contexts are identified by unique keys (ContextKeys objects). These keys always contain the
     * identifier of the ContextView to which they belong and optional as many key-value pairs as
     * required to make them unique.
     *
     * @par Providing contexts
     *
     * To create a ContextView provide contexts, a derivat of ContextView must set the flag
     * ProvidesContexts. Each such view that wants to provide a context must also implement a
     * derivat of ViewContext and return a new instance of it in the overloaded
     * ContextView::createContextObject() method.
     *
     * A pattern that can be followed for creation of new contexts is shown in the
     * ContextView::createContextObject() method documentation.
     *
     * @note    There are rare cases where it is not required to create a class inheriting from
     *          ViewContext. This is the case when all data can be stored into ViewContextData
     *          objects. However, in this scenario there is no direct call back for context
     *          switching. You can gain knowledge of the context change indirectly through the
     *          ViewContextData events, though.
     *
     * @par Consuming contexts
     *
     * To consume a context, one has to set the flag ConsumesContexts on the derivat of the
     * ContextView. The view must then know which contexts to attach to. This is done by giving the
     * identifier() of the providing view to setContextProvider().
     *
     * libHeaven will then internally call to ContextView::attachedContext() and
     * ContextView::detachedContext() as it is required. These method should be overloaded to
     * implement reactions to the context change in the providing view.
     *
     * Typical implementations are:
     * - For detachedContext(): Return the view to a state displaying nothing (i.e. like when the
     *   application was just started).
     * - For attachedContext(): Bring the view to display the state that is demanded by the context.
     *
     * @par Providing and consuming contexts at the same time
     *
     * It is possible to be consuming contexts and at the same time providing context to other
     * views. This way, it is possible to create a hierarchical data dependance.
     *
     *
     * @class   ViewContextPrivate
     * @internal
     * @ingroup CentralUI
     * @brief   Internal bridge between ViewContextManager and ViewContext
     *
     * Most of the implementation of ViewContext goes here. This class befriends the Manager and the
     * Context.
